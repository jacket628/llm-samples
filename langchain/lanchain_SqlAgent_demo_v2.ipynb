temp_right_tag = \\'合格\\' and DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH) <= shipping_create_time;\\n\\nThe query above counts the number of shipping orders that were temperature-qualified in the last month. The temperature-qualified status is determined by the value of the column temp_right_tag. The date used in the comparison is the current date minus one month. This is because the shipping orders are expected to be created in the last month.\\n\\nThe result of this query is a single number, which is the number of temperature-qualified shipping orders in the last month.\\n\\nThe query uses a subquery to determine the number of temperature-qualified shipping orders in the last month. This is because the query cannot reference the date directly in the WHERE clause. Instead, it must use a subquery to calculate the date based on the current date and the interval. This is because the date in the WHERE clause cannot be used in the comparison.\\n\\nThe subquery uses the DATE_SUB function to subtract the interval from the current date. The INTERVAL keyword is followed by the number of months and the time unit. The unit can be YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND.\\n\\nThe subquery is then used in the main query as the value of the date in the comparison. This is because the date in the WHERE clause cannot be used in the comparison.\\n\\nThe query uses the COUNT function to count the number of rows in the result.\\n\\nThe query uses the FROM clause to select from the table ads_bi_quality'"
